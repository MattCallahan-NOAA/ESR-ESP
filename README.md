# ESR-ESP
This repo contains code for satellite derived environmental indicators used in the Alaska Fisheries Science Center Ecosystem Status Report (ESR) and Ecological and Socioeconomic Profile (ESP). 

I organized this repo by data type (SST and Chla so far), with ESP and ESR subfolders in each.

Shout out to Jordan Watson who originally developed much of this code.
