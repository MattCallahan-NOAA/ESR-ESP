Code to automate ESP Satellite SST indicators within the AKFIN database

As of 2021, there were four ESP indicators calculated from SST stored in AKFIN.

**Spring_Temperature_Surface_EGOA_Satellite:** "Late spring (May-June) daily sea surface temperatures (SST) on a 5 km grid averaged over the eastern GOA (NMFS areas 640 and 650, no depth restriction) (Watson, 2020) from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Program which provides the Global 5km Satellite sea surface temperatures 1985 to present. 

**Spring_Temperature_Surface_WCGOA_Satellite:** "Spring (April-May) daily sea surface temperatures (SST) on a 5 km grid averaged over the western and central GOA (combined over the 10m-200m shelf for NMFS areas 610, 620, 630) (Watson, 2020) from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Program which provides the Global 5km Satellite sea surface temperatures from 1985 to present.

**Spring_Temperature_Surface_SEBS_Satellite:** "Late spring (May-June) daily sea surface temperatures (SST) on a 5 km grid averaged over the southeastern Bering Sea (deeper than 10 m) (Watson, 2020) from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Program which provides the Global 5km Satellite sea surface temperatures  1985 to present.

**Spring_Summer_Temperature_Surface_SEBS_Satellite:** "Spring to summer (April-June) daily sea surface temperatures (SST) on a 5 km grid averaged over the southeastern Bering sea (10 m to shelf break (200 m) south of 60 degN) (Watson, 2020) from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Program which provides the Global 5km Satellite sea surface temperatures from 1985 to present.

 Code for the original indicators calculated by Jordan Watson can be found at https://github.com/jordanwatson/ESP_Indicators"
 
 We replicate these calculations in the esp_indicator_automation.sql file
