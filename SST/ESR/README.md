# ESR
This code is run annually to generate figures for each region. SST contributions are edited by authors using google docs. 

Here is an example of the final product (2022) https://apps-afsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/REFM/docs/2022/EBSecosys.pdf

This code is modified from Jordan Watson's ESR code from 2021 and earlier, which can be found at https://github.com/jordanwatson/EcosystemStatusReports.
